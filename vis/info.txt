Manually labeled 50 lines of sentiment out of hamlet.txt

For out set of 50 lines, only 14/50 (30%) of those lines were mislabeled.
For out of the 14 line only 2 (13%) were mislabeling sentiment (labeling positive when it is actually negative or vise versa)

One thing that I encountered when labeling the data was that sentiment is very hard to retreive from the text and much of it is either non-existant or very subtle. This can show that using sentiment dictionaries to identify the main, large expressions of either positive or negative sentiment can be very effective. For further tuning we can analyze context of sentiment words to identify cases when sentiment attribution is not important.

The use of early modern english in these Shakespearian plays made sentiment attribution difficult even when being interpereted manually. This is something to consider when running the application on different types of plays.
